![Analysis Plot 3](/screenshots/load-file/cxml-load-file-analysis-plots-2.png)
![Analysis Plot 4](/screenshots/load-file/cxml-load-file-analysis-plots-3.png)

These plots provide insights into:

- Molecular distributions
- Feature relationships
- Data patterns
- Statistical properties

## Supported File Formats

ChemXploreML supports various molecular file formats:

- SDF (Structure Data File)
- SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System)
- CSV files with molecular data
- Other common chemical file formats

## Next Steps

After loading your file, you can:

1. Perform molecular analysis
2. Generate molecular embeddings
3. Apply dimensionality reduction
4. Train machine learning models
